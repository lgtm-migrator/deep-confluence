  ====
  > Deep Confluence is a Javascript Utility Method to deeply merge objects.
  - meant for: legibility, simplicity, testability, and utility
  - not meant for: complex {object}/[array] merging with very particular needs which can easily be tested
  - usecase/audiance: I want to use a bare-bones deep extend method that I can understand
